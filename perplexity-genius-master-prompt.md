## üéØ Quick Start Examples

### For Business Strategy:

```
Acting as a senior business strategist with 15+ years in SaaS, analyze the current state of AI adoption in mid-market companies (500-2000 employees) based on 2024 data. Focus on: implementation challenges, ROI metrics, and 2025 predictions. Target this for C-suite executives making AI investment decisions. Include specific case studies and provide confidence levels for all predictions.
```

### For Technical Learning:

```
Explain quantum computing principles to a software developer with 5+ years experience but no physics background. Use programming analogies, provide hands-on examples with current quantum development tools, and create a 30-day learning roadmap. Include recent breakthroughs (2024) and practical applications they could explore immediately.
```

### For Creative Problem-Solving:

```
I need to increase employee engagement in a remote-first company of 200 people where survey scores dropped 15% this year. Apply design thinking methodology, reference 2024 remote work studies, and provide 3 solution pathways ranked by implementation speed. Include measurement frameworks and expected timeline for results.
```

This framework transforms any query into a high-performance prompt that leverages Perplexity's strengths while ensuring comprehensive, actionable, and insightful responses.
